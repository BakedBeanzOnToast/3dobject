<h2>Above is an early draft of my final pirate ship. It was originally inspired by the game Sid Meier's Pirates! which was a game released in 2004 by Atari, Firaxis Games and 2K Games, which I played on an iPad in Primary school.<br>In this game you could bombard a city by aiming cannons at buildings and port cannons (shown below), which inspired my drawing on both Tilt Brush and Google Blocks.</h2>

<h2>I used Sketchfab to host my 3D Objects as it is easy to rotate around the object and scroll in to view intricate details to change lighting effects, shadows, backgrounds, sharpness and even textures.</h2>

<h2>My final 3D object contains a finished pirate ship with a pirate flag, a cannon fired with fire effects, two lanterns that glow on the front and back, a captain's quarters and storage below deck with crates of goods.<br>On land there are two buildings, a cannon firing back, and a palm tree, complete with coconuts because Pirates! is set in the Caribbean.<br>I made this 3D object like it was an action scene stuck in time.</h2>
