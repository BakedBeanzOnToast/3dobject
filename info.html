<h2>Tilt Brush was chosen after I trialed Google Blocks and Unreal Engine. <br>Google Blocks was a program not fit fully for my purpose as each block that was drawn/placed had to be even and straight, which is hard to make sure of when using Virtual Reality controllers. I did re-create my Pirate Ship onto Google Blocks to show it was possible to draw it, but in my opinion doesn't look as good quality, and as sharp as its counterpart - Tilt Brush.<br>Although some issues were still present, for example it's hard to know if your hand is completely straight or not when drawing. Despite this, I could place more intricate detail onto my 3D Object such as waves in the sea and glowing lanterns on the boat</h2><br>
